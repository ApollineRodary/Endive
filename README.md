# Endive

# The Interface

In the directory _endive-gui_ is a mockup proposition of an interface using CodeMirror for the editable area, HTML, CSS and Javascript for the rest of the interface, and Electron to make it into a standalone software.

Ideally, the Interface and the Software should be sufficiently modular so that the interface can be used as is in any web browser (either hiding the menus about saving and loading files, or providing replacements for them).

To use the interface, go into the Software folder with a terminal, and type "npm start". You can then type text, load and save files. (Menu can be accessed pressinc Esc, and options can be selected typing the underlined letter)

More details about the implementation are to be found inside the folders
